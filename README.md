A translation system for Old Assyrian: decode the everyday business records of ancient Assyrian merchants, using 8,000 cuneiform texts.

Four thousand years ago, Assyrian merchants left behind one of the world’s richest archives of everyday and commercial life. Tens of thousands of clay tablets record debts settled, caravans dispatched, and discuss day-to-day family matters. This woule be one of the largest untranslated archive of the ancient world. 

### Goal: 
neural machine-translation models that convert transliterated Akkadian into English  

### Context and Challenges:
The challenge: Akkadian is a low-resource, morphologically complex language where a single word can encode what takes multiple words in English. Standard architectures built for modern, data-rich languages fail here.

Context: Old Assyrian—the dialect used on these tablets—is an early form of Akkadian, the oldest documented Semitic language - bronze Age texts from museum collections for over a century. Nearly 23,000 tablets survive documenting the Old Assyrian trading networks that connected Mesopotamia to Anatolia. Only half have been translated, and less than a dozen scholars in the world are specialized to read the rest. These aren’t the polished classics of Greece and Rome, curated and copied by scribes who chose whose voices survived. These are unfiltered, straight from the people who wrote them: letters, invoices and contracts written on clay by ancient merchants and their families. They’re the Instagram stories of the Bronze Age: mundane, immediate, and breathtakingly real.
